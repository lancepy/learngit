Self-learning
 if you are just like me who knows nothing about python or git or anything you want but not achieved, it is alright, nothing can stop you to learn what you want unless you really mean to make a change and impove youself.

#About me 
I'm a student of one of the universities in Nan Jing, well, what you do now or what kind of colleges you are from do not really matter. It is self-learning and the ability to learn something you like that really matter to you life.
